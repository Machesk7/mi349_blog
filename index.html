                <h2>Liv Golf Tour's Impact on the World of Golf</h2>

                <p>There has been lots of discussions taking place in the world of golf over the past year or so in regards to a new professional tour going live. The new tour, named "LIV Golf", entices players through large, guarenteed paychecks through a more relaxed tournament schedule. The tour has gathered lots of attention through signing some big name players, such as Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Bryson Dechambeau, and Cam Smith. This league has been criticized by many for its financial backers, the Saudi Arabian Government. People are continuing to question the legitimacy of this tour as it has struggled to gain a high viewership count. Personally, I do not think the tour does enough to make it more exciting to watch as a fan of the sport. Players seem to treat the tournaments as exhibition rounds, as they have looser dress code rules, you cannot get cut, and you only play 3 rounds per event compared to 4. Besides signing a few big name players, the rest of the field is very weak compared to the rest of the professional golfing tours, mainly the PGA Tour. I think that the league is going to fizzle out and not make nearly enough money to compensate for the ridiculous wages they are paying their players. One good thing that has come from the tour is a higher sense of accountability on the PGA Tour to pay their players more competitive wages.<p>
