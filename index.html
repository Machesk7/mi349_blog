                    <h2>Liv Golf Tour's Impact on the World of Golf</h2>
                    <h3>10-16-2022</h3>
                    <h4>Jack Machesky</h4>
                    <p>There has been lots of discussions taking place in the world of golf over the past year or so in regards to a new professional tour going live. The new tour, named "LIV Golf", entices players through large, guarenteed paychecks through a more relaxed tournament schedule. The tour has gathered lots of attention through signing some big name players, such as Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Bryson Dechambeau, and Cam Smith. This league has been criticized by many for its financial backers, the Saudi Arabian Government. People are continuing to question the legitimacy of this tour as it has struggled to gain a high viewership count. Personally, I do not think the tour does enough to make it more exciting to watch as a fan of the sport. Players seem to treat the tournaments as exhibition rounds, as they have looser dress code rules, you cannot get cut, and you only play 3 rounds per event compared to 4. Besides signing a few big name players, the rest of the field is very weak compared to the rest of the professional golfing tours, mainly the PGA Tour. I think that the league is going to fizzle out and not make nearly enough money to compensate for the ridiculous wages they are paying their players. One good thing that has come from the tour is a higher sense of accountability on the PGA Tour to pay their players more competitive wages.</p>

                <h2>My favorite Golf Courses in Michigan</h2>
                <h3>10-16-2022</h3>
                <h4>Jack Machesky</h4>
                <p>Growing up in Southeast Michigan has allowed me to play at a plethora of amazing golf courses without breaking the bank. In my hometown, I am able to drive about 30 minutes in any direction and be able to find an enjoyable course. We truly are spoiled with the amount of value courses exist in Michigan, and I have got the chance to play lots of them. My favorite course that I play at when I am in my hometown is Coyote Golf Club in New Hudson. It offers a great challenge to players of all skill levels, and the breath taking views and fantastic upkeep of the course will have you coming back for more. Another course that I really enjoy is Northville Hills Golf Club in Northville, Michigan. It was designed by Arnold Palmer and routes you through the rolling meadows and wooded terrain of a neighborhood, while at the same time making you forget that sometimes your ball might end up in someones back yard. My favorite course that I have ever played is Forest Dunes Golf Club in Rosscommon, MI. It is rather pricey, but the course is simply breath taking. Fantastic greens that roll fast and true, a mix of routing throug the hardwood forests of Northern Michigan and the sand dune like terrain makes this course very fun and unique. You will simply forget you are in pretty much the middle of nowhere when you are finding your way around the course.</p>
